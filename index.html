      <h1>Weiqi</h1>
      <p><b>Weiqi</b> is an abstract strategy board game for 2 players in which the aim is to gain more territory than the opponent. It is the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. In the past, <b>Weiqi</b> was considered oneof the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic Chinese scholars in antiquity.</p>

      <h1>Pure Mathematics</h1>
      <p id="testP">Mathematics is both an art and a science, and pure mathematics lies at its heart. Pure mathematics explores the boundary of mathematics and pure reason. It has been described as "that part of mathematical activity that is done without explicit or immediate consideration of direct application," although what is "pure" in one era often becomes applied later. Finance and cryptography are current examples of areas to which pure mathematics is applied in significant ways.</p>

      <h1>Literature</h1>
      <p>I'm not very well versed in the field of <b>Literature</b>, but, only recently, have I started taking another look into this field. I don't know. I honestly don't know why. I was never an avid reader. I never took a great interest or learned to appreciate great novels and such. I partly blame this phenomenon to English not being my first language. It's really a difficult task to make a non-native speaking person to enjoy English Literature. I, however, will rechallenge myself to get back into this field because I don't have all the money in the world to have a cup of coffee with nobel laurets in Literature, however, I do have couple bucks to purchase their books and better understand their bright mind. </p>

      <h1>League of Legends</h1>
      <p class="funParagraph"><b>League of Legends</b> is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off rto destroy the other's basre. you can choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays, secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory. Sadly, there are times when I've sacrificed 17 valuable hours of my day into this game. I closed this season with top 2 percent in the game. I'm wishing that I can do better once the new season starts.</p>
